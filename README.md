### Compiling and Running:
1. Compile StartScreen.java
2. Run StartScreen.java

### How to Use:
0. Board layout: columns are numbered a-h, rows are numbered 1-8. To move, enter the column number and then row number of the piece you want to move, then the column and row number of where you want the piece to go. For example: if you want to observer's top leftmost pawn one down, that would be: a2 a3. If you say yes to a timed match, each move must be made before 1 minute is up.
                   
1. Player 1, white, goes first (the top of the board). If a timed match, make your move before 1 minute is up, or your move will not be valid.
2. Player 2, black, goes next (bottom of the screen). If a timed match, make your move before 1 minute is up, or your move will not be valid.
3. Repeat until someone wins.
